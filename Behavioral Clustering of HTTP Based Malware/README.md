Implementation of the paper: Perdisci, Roberto, Wenke Lee, and Nick Feamster. "Behavioral clustering of http-based malware and signature generation using malicious network traces." In NSDI, vol. 10, p. 14. 2010.


# Ensure that the following are in your directory:
   - requirements.txt
   - Hierarchical_Clustering.py
   - Network_clean_backdoor_downloader_v2.csv

# Virtual environment & Dependencies
*Create a virtual environment*
```
python3 -m venv test_venv
```
*Activate the Virtual Environment*
```
source ./test_venv/bin/activate
```
*Install the required packages*
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running & Generating Results
We tried 3 clustering algorithms. Instructions to run each of them:

### 1. K-means
```
python3 k-means.py 
```
This will generate two files kmeans_clusters.txt and elbow_method_for_optimal_k.png both of these are explained in the report.

### 2, 3. Single Linkage Hierarchical Clustering & Ward Linkage Hierarchical Clustering
```
python3 Hierarchical_Clustering.py
```
This will generate all the plots we used in the report and keep them in the current directory & also it will print the corresponding data we used in the report in the command line. For information on what those plots are see the Report.
